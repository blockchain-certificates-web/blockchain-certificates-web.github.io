## Standards Alignment

Blockcerts uses open standards for recipient-centric certificates. The [cert-schema repo](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-schema) describes Blockcerts' Open Badges extensions enabling Blockchain verification

The Blockcerts community is aligned with (and contributing to) the following standards:

* [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0) see compliance report: [https://www.blockcerts.org/vc-v2-compliance-report.html](https://www.blockcerts.org/vc-v2-compliance-report.html)
* [W3C Data Integrity](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity) see compliance report: [https://www.blockcerts.org/di-v1-compliance-report.html](https://www.blockcerts.org/di-v1-compliance-report.html)
* [W3C / W3C Controlled Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/cid-1.0/) including support for [W3C Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/)

Blockcertsâ€™ open-source components conform to the above standards, demonstrating how such standards can be used in a viable system. This includes generating solutions for subtle difficulties arising in a real-world system, including:

* revocation of certificates
* identity of participants in a decentralized, self-sovereign mode
* other lifecycle concerns, including key management

### Design Principles

*   Open source
*   Reliance on open standards
*   Open participation
*   Recipient control
*   Simplicity
*   Minimize resource requirements (computation, cost, etc.)
*   Solution must be viable without any proprietary product
*   Blockchain-agnostic in the long term
*   Maximize confidence in the end product
